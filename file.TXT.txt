For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Shall hate be fairer lodg'd then gentle love?
	Make thee another self for love of me,
	And all in war with Time for love of you,
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
	Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
	No love toward others in that bosom sits
